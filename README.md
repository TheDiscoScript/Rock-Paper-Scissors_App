# odinProject---R-P-S-with-UI

I made UI for ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS which I have wrote earlier in the course

What I learned
- how to make page interactive
- eventlisteners 
- DOMs
- createElements etc.
- querySelectors
- Functions, calling functions within functions

Took me longer that I would hav guessed, but I don't mind. It was first time combining HTML,CSS and JS. It doesn't look so great, it is missing some features (for example New Game function) but overall I am quite happy and I am going to push forward through the course.
